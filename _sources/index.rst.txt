Welcome to Processing pipe's documentation!
===========================================

Processing pipe is a tool, based on Ecto, that provides an easy way to create
computational graphs (Ecto plasms) from a JSON file. Its most basic function is
to run graphs exactly as they are described, but its most essential feature is
to evaluate algorithms embedded in a graph using
`qidata <https://aldebaran.github.io/qidata_doc/>`_ annotations.
